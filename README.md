# Other
This is the place where I dump all of the odds-n-ends scripts that I end up writing. 
Most of the time I write these scripts to make something a little simpler/easier for me to do.
If you find something in here that is useful to you, let me know! I'd like to hear about it.

So long, and thanks for all the fish!
